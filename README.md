This is my realization of Hexlet's Brain Games. Here you can practice with prime numbers, even and uneven numbers, simple calculations and determining greatest commod divisors for number pairs.

To install this game package you need command line tool <pip>:
```
pip install --user git+https://github.com/fiftinmen/python-project-49
```
You might get warning that script installed in directory which is not in your PATH environment variable. 
Then type in you command line name of chosen game: brain-prime, brain-gcd, brain-even, brain-calc or brain-progression like that:
```
brain-prime
```
Then follow instructions and enjoy playing brain games.
